                When it comes to UI and UX, it seems like newbie developer ignoring them so hard that they thought functionality first, experience later. Aren't we all? My carrier of web development started when I was in vocational school, if I recall it right, websites I built back then is lacking of UI and UX aspects. All I build is "what is good for me then it's good enough".
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I realised how selfish I am back then. UI is not something like "I see that good enough, then it would be good for others, too". IT'S WRONG! Somehow I hate and love UI/UX at the same time because it's complexity and many theories I have to implement.

                Let's back in track to the book itself. At the first glance I don't really know who in the world are Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan are, but once I knew they are the person behind Tailwind CSS, I knew this book is not a joke for real.

                First two chapters are the fundamentals on how the design work from scratch. I taught to start with a feature, not a layout. This punch me right in the face because almost in my entire project, I start with a navbar. Not a good start. I also pay attention to the details since the beginning of the project, which will make me confused and take more time then expected. Other than that, plenty of choices of designs makes me confused and ended up being not making any further progress.

                This book also taught me to pay attention to the element hierarchy, start with the simplest element, Headings. In markup language, we know that H1 to H6 are the common headings, but when we will use each element? How we should implement those? Turns out you don't have to use it all, just use the important one and make sure it doesn't ruin your visual hierarchy. Emphasize the main content first, and emphasize other by de-emphasize it.

                There's a lot to learn in this book, and I'm afraid I couldn't cover each chapter. So make sure you bought the copy of <a href="https://refactoringui.com/" target="_blank">Refactoring UI</a>, the price worth the knowledge you will get. The book itself is about four to six hours long to read, so it also worth the time killer when you're bored.

                Thanks for reading my first note! Hope you enjoy this non-sense.
